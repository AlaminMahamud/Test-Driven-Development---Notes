## Money Example

### Objectives

- Multi Currency Support for existing Dollar based Payment System

### Workflow

- Quickly add a test
- Run all tests  and see the new one  fail
- Make a Little change
- Run all tests and see them all succeed
- Refactor to remove duplication
 
### Possibilities

*Method*: Team needs to have a consistent experience growing the design of the system, little by little so the mechanics of the transformation are well practiced

*Motive* - business importance of  the feature and have the courage to do seemingly impossible task

*Opportunity* - combination of comprehensive, confidence-generated tests, well-factored program makes possible to isolate design decision which helps the team to identify the few potential sources of errors 
 
### Thoughts
- How each test  cover a small increment of functionality
- How small and ugly the changes can be to make the new tests run
- How often the tests are run
- How many teensy-weensy steps make up the refactorings
