## Concepts

### Types of Test

- **Unit tests**: Make sure a class or a function works as expected in isolation
- **Functional tests**: Verify that the microservice does what it says from the consumer's point of view, and behaves correctly even on bad requests
- **Integration tests**: Verify how a microservice integrates with all its network dependencies
- **Load tests**: Measure the microservice performances
- **End-to-end tests**: Verify that the whole system works with an end-to-end test
